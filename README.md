## Motivation:
HR treated my CV as if it were toilet paper, indicating a reluctance to invest time in reviewing it. I believe they aim to avoid wasting time on lengthy CVs. Therefore, I've resolved to initiate this project to provide other developers with an opportunity to practice and enable HR to assess candidates' skills and mindset more effectively.

## Depend on the following libraries and tools:
- [private-gpt](https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt)
